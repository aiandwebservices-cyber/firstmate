# Process-to-event runner verification

Audience: maintainer verification.

This record holds reusable version-scoped evidence for the runner's active guarantees.
`docs/configuration.md` owns the operating contract, each script's header and `--help` own its mechanics, and `.agents/skills/process-event-sources/SKILL.md` owns the handling procedure.

Verified on 2026-07-31 on macOS (Darwin 25.5.0) with `lavish-axi` 0.1.45 installed.

## The published Lavish poll interface the adapter wraps

Verified at implementation time without upgrading the installed build:

```sh
$ lavish-axi --version
0.1.45
$ lavish-axi poll --help | head -1
Usage: lavish-axi poll <html-file> [--agent-reply "..."]
```

The same help states that the command "long-polls indefinitely".
The adapter therefore registers the plain blocking form with no timeout flag, so a completion is a real server-side event rather than a timer expiry.

This build exposes no capabilities command and no multiplexed or subscription endpoint:

```sh
$ lavish-axi capabilities --json
error: Lavish Editor expects an HTML file
code: VALIDATION_ERROR   # exit 2
```

Exit 2 with `VALIDATION_ERROR` is positive proof the subcommand does not exist, because the word is parsed as a filename.
Note that `lavish-axi <anything> --help` exits 0 for any argument, including a nonsense subcommand, so a `--help` exit code can never be used as a capability probe.

The adapter depends on none of this: it uses only the published poll shape above.

## The loss limitation this runner cannot close

The published poll clears feedback destructively before returning it.
Measured at the protocol layer by consuming and discarding the response:

```text
consuming read http=200
listing after: ...,open,"...",0
state.json: status= open pending= 0 prompts= []  chat entries= []
```

Nothing remains on the source side to re-read, and there is no acknowledgement, cursor, or replay surface to reserve against.
A result lost after that clearing and before the runner reads the child's output is therefore unrecoverable.

**Consequence for wording:** the runner may describe only its own durability boundary.
Never at-least-once, no-loss, or lossless.

## What the runner does prove

Exercised by `tests/fm-procevent.test.sh` against a fake blocking source whose completion is a process event, not a timer:

| Guarantee | How it is proven |
| --- | --- |
| capture before publication | the captured result exists at `0600` and its event references it only afterward |
| restart recovery | a durable result with no announcement marker is re-announced by `reconcile`, once, with no second durable copy and no duplicated wake |
| one owner per canonical source | a second home's `start` for the same source id reports `already owned` and publishes nothing |
| canonical physical identity | a final-component symlink and its target produce the same Lavish source id |
| stale reclaim without displacement | concurrent contenders replacing one stale claim start exactly one runner |
| PID-reuse safety | retirement refuses to signal a live PID whose identity differs from the claim |
| coherent ownership reads | a claim replacement held inside the source boundary blocks `list` until one complete generation is visible |
| retire-start exclusion | a queued start revalidates registration after the serialized retirement boundary and executes no child |
| uncertain identity | a live owner whose identity probe transiently fails is not signaled or released, and its registration remains for retry |
| bounded home sweep | registrations and claim-only owned sources retire through the ordinary safe path before home deletion |
| sweep refusal | uncertain identity preserves the runner, claim, registration, home, lease, and parent retirement evidence for retry |
| foreign ownership | sweeping one home removes its registration without signaling or releasing another home's live claim |
| nested and force cleanup | normal, force, and nested secondmate removal invoke each target home's sweep before deletion |
| healthy-home invariance | homes with no registration or owned runner claim retain ordinary registration-only supervision and teardown behavior |
| source-only supervision | a registered source with no task metadata trips the shared predicate and general guard |
| argv integrity | an argument containing spaces survives as one argument, and a shell-looking argument is passed literally with no interpretation |
| bounded output | output beyond `FM_PROCEVENT_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` is truncated and still captured, never published whole or dropped |
| silent failure handling | a nonzero exit with no output publishes nothing and leaves the source registered for retry |
| inertness | a home with no registered source generates no state, starts no process, and does not need supervision |

## Runner lifetime and cleanup

A runner started by `reconcile` is its own process group leader and is reparented to init, so it outlives the shell that started it by design.
That means nothing about the starting context can reap it: removing a home's state directory does not stop an already-running child, and signalling only the runner leaves the blocking child alive.

Two paths therefore stop a runner, and both signal the **process group** so the blocked child cannot survive its supervisor:

- `retire` resolves the runner PID and identity from this home's machine-wide claim, so retirement still works when the home's state is already gone.
- `reconcile` stops a runner this home owns whose source registration has been removed, and reports it as `stopped=N`.

This was found by four orphaned runners, elapsed 6-13 minutes, left by a suite whose fixture source never completed.
`tests/fm-procevent.test.sh` now covers both paths, and three consecutive suite runs leave zero runners, zero fixture children, and zero stray claims.

## Portability finding

`setsid` is **not present on macOS**, so it cannot be used to detach a runner.
`reconcile` uses `perl -e 'setpgrp(0, 0); exec @ARGV'` as the portable equivalent, the same fallback shape `bin/fm-watch.sh` already uses for bounded check execution.
Without this, reconcile would silently fail to start any runner on macOS.

## Scope

The runner is domain-neutral and creates no endpoint, task metadata, or backlog item, so the supported primary harnesses and runtime backends are unaffected except through the `check` wake they already consume.
Lavish is the first adapter; adding another requires only a new `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh`.
